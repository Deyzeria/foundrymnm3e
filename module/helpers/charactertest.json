A degree of failure indicates you spend your move action just maintaining your balance and do not actually move, while two or more degrees of failure means you lose your balance and fall. You are vulnerable while balancing. If you accept a +5 increase to the Acrobatics DC, you are not vulnerable.\n\nManeuvering: You can make Acrobatics checks for various acrobatic stunts or maneuvers, from back flips to jumping over an opponent (to get behind them), flipping up onto a ledge, tumbling through obstacles, and so forth. The GM sets the DC. Success means you accomplish the maneuver.\n\nStanding: You can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to go from prone to standing as a free action rather than a move action. A failed check means you remain prone.\n\nTumbling: You can make an Acrobatics check (DC 5) to lessen damage from a fall, reducing the damage by 1 per degree. A fall reduced to rank 0 damage does no damage and you quickly roll to your feet as a free action. Otherwise, you are prone at the end of a fall.",

A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface can't be climbed without the Wall-crawling effect of Movement (see the Powers chapter).\n\nJumping: The result of an Athletics check is the distance (in feet) you can clear in a running long-jump. If you make a standing jump, divide the distance in half. If you make a vertical jump (straight up) divide the distance by 5, and if you make a standing vertical jump, divide it by 10. Your Athletics bonus + 10 is the base distance you can jump under routine circumstances.\n\nRunning: You can make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to run faster: success increases your ground speed rank by +1 for one round.\n\nSwimming: A successful DC 10 Athletics check allows you to swim your ground speed rank minus 2 as a move action. If the check fails, you make no progress through the water during the action. With more than one degree of failure, you go under. If underwater, you must hold your breath to avoid drowning.",

A bluff is usually opposed by the target's Deception or Insight check. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome.\n\nDisguise: You can use makeup, costumes, and other props to change your appearance. Your Deception check result determines the effectiveness of the disguise, opposed by others' Perception check results. The GM makes the Deception check secretly, so you are not sure exactly how well your disguise holds up under scrutiny.\n\nFeinting: You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a standard action. If your Deception check succeeds, the target is vulnerable against your next attack, until the end of your next round (see Vulnerable in the Conditions section of The Basics chapter).\n\nInnuendo: You can use Deception to send covert messages using wordplay and double-meanings while apparently talking about other things. The DC for a basic message is 10. Complex messages or messages trying to communicate new information have DCs of 15 or 20, respectively. The recipient of the message must make an Insight check against the same DC to understand it.\n\nTricking: You can use Deception to mislead an opponent into taking a potentially unwise action, such as trying to hit you while standing in front of an electrical junction box or at the edge of a precipice. If your Deception check opposed by Deception or Insight succeeds, your opponent is heedless of the potential danger and may hit the junction box or lose his balance and fall, if his attack against you fails.",

See the Illusion effect in the Powers chapter for details.\n\nDetect Influence: You can make an Insight check to notice someone acting under outside influence.

Three or more degrees give you a general idea of what is influencing them (and perhaps even whom, depending on the situation and the Gamemaster's  judgment).\n\nEvaluate: With an Insight check, opposed by Deception, you can tell if someone is trustworthy and honorable (or not) upon meeting them. You can also make an Insight check (DC 20) to evaluate a social situation, getting a feel for the overall mood and prevailing attitudes. Two or more degrees of failure on either check mean you misinterpret the signs, so the GM may make these checks for you in secret.\n\nInnuendo: You can use Insight to pick up on hidden messages sent via the Deception skill (see the Deception skill description).\n\nResist Influence: Make an Insight check when called to do so to resist or overcome the effects of certain interaction skills, such as Deception or Intimidation.

With four or more degrees of success, the target is disabled (a -5 penalty) until the end of your next round.\n\nIntimidating Minions: You can intimidate a whole group of minions - who can all see and hear you - with a single check.

Perception allows you to immediately notice things, while an Investigation check allows you to pick up on details with some effort.\n\nGather Evidence: To collect a piece of evidence for analysis, make an Investigation check (DC 15). If the check succeeds, the evidence can be analyzed (see the following). If the check fails, an analysis can be done, but with a -5 penalty for highly unfavorable circumstances. With more than one degree of failure, the evidence is ruined and no analysis can be done. On the other hand, two or more degrees of success provide a +2 circumstance bonus to later analysis.\n\nAnalyze Evidence: You can make an Investigation check to apply forensic knowledge to evidence. This function of Investigation does not give you clues where none exist. It simply allows you to extract useful information from evidence and clues you have found.\n\nGather Information: You know how to make contacts, collect gossip and rumors, question informants, and otherwise get information from people.\n\nSurveillance: You can set up surveillance of a particular area, watching from a stationary location. The DC of the subject's Stealth check to evade your notice is equal to the result of your Investigation check. For actively following a subject, see Tailing in the Stealth skill description.",

Normal conversation is DC 0, a soft noise DC 10. Listening through a door is +5 DC, +15 for a solid wall. While you're asleep, hearing something well enough to wake up is +10 DC.\n\nSeeing: Make a check against a DC based on how visible the object is or against an opposed Stealth check. Something in plain sight is DC 0, while something subtle or easily overlooked may be DC 5, 10 or more. Visual perception is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Deception skill) or to notice a concealed object (see the Sleight of Hand skill).\n\nOther Senses: You can make Perception checks involving other sense types as well (see the Powers chapter for more on sense types). Noticing something obvious to a sense is DC 0. Less obvious things are DC 10 or so, hidden things DC 20 or more, and discerning details requires at least three degrees of success, as usual.",

Your target makes a Perception check and notices the attempt if his check result beats yours, whether you succeed in taking the object or not.

Without the proper tools or equipment, you take a -5 penalty to Technology checks for highly unfavorable circumstances.\n\nOperating: Most routine operations of technological equipment don't require a skill check and can be done untrained. Using an unfamiliar device does require a check, with the DC determined by how foreign or unusual the device is, from simple (DC 10) to highly advanced (DC 25 or more).\n\nBuilding: The difficulty and time required to make an item depends on its complexity, as shown on the Building Items table. If your Technology check succeeds, you have made the item after the necessary time.\n\nRepairing: You can also use Technology to repair damaged items, with a -5 to the DC to build the item and -2 to the time rank required. So you can perform repairs on a complex item in eight hours (time rank 12) with a DC of 20.\n\nJury-rigging: You can also attempt jury-rigged, or temporary, repairs. Doing this reduces the repair DC by an additional 5 (for a total of -10 to the DC to build the item), and allows you to make the Technology check as a standard action. However, a jury-rigged repair can only fix a single problem, and the repair only lasts until the end of the scene.\n\nDemolitions: Careful placement of an explosive against a fixed structure can maximize damage by exploiting vulnerabilities in the structure. This requires at least a minute and a DC 10 Technology check. The GM makes the check, so you don't know exactly how well you have done until the explosive goes off.\n\nInventing: If you have the Inventor advantage (see the Advantages chapter), you can use Technology to create inventions, temporary devices. See Inventing, page 145, for details.\n\nSecurity: You can use Technology to disarm or sabotage various security devices, including locks, traps, and sensors. This takes at least a minute, possibly longer, at the GM's discretion. The GM makes your Technology check secretly, so you don't necessarily know right away if you have succeeded.",
