A degree of failure indicates you spend your move action just maintaining your balance and do not actually move, while two or more degrees of failure means you lose your balance and fall. You are vulnerable while balancing. If you accept a +5 increase to the Acrobatics DC, you are not vulnerable.\n\nManeuvering: You can make Acrobatics checks for various acrobatic stunts or maneuvers, from back flips to jumping over an opponent (to get behind them), flipping up onto a ledge, tumbling through obstacles, and so forth. The GM sets the DC. Success means you accomplish the maneuver.\n\nStanding: You can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to go from prone to standing as a free action rather than a move action. A failed check means you remain prone.\n\nTumbling: You can make an Acrobatics check (DC 5) to lessen damage from a fall, reducing the damage by 1 per degree. A fall reduced to rank 0 damage does no damage and you quickly roll to your feet as a free action. Otherwise, you are prone at the end of a fall.",

If you make a standing jump, divide the distance in half. If you make a vertical jump (straight up) divide the distance by 5, and if you make a standing vertical jump, divide it by 10. Your Athletics bonus + 10 is the base distance you can jump under routine circumstances.\n\nRunning: You can make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to run faster: success increases your ground speed rank by +1 for one round.\n\nSwimming: A successful DC 10 Athletics check allows you to swim your ground speed rank minus 2 as a move action. If the check fails, you make no progress through the water during the action. With more than one degree of failure, you go under. If underwater, you must hold your breath to avoid drowning.",

Deception takes as long as it takes to spin-out your story.\n\nBluffing: Make a Deception check to tell a believable lie or get someone do go along with you. A bluff is usually opposed by the target's Deception or Insight check. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome.\n\nDisguise: You can use makeup, costumes, and other props to change your appearance. Your Deception check result determines the effectiveness of the disguise, opposed by others' Perception check results. The GM makes the Deception check secretly, so you are not sure exactly how well your disguise holds up under scrutiny.\n\nFeinting: You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a standard action. If your Deception check succeeds, the target is vulnerable against your next attack, until the end of your next round (see Vulnerable in the Conditions section of The Basics chapter).\n\nInnuendo: You can use Deception to send covert messages using wordplay and double-meanings while apparently talking about other things. The DC for a basic message is 10. Complex messages or messages trying to communicate new information have DCs of 15 or 20, respectively. The recipient of the message must make an Insight check against the same DC to understand it.\n\nTricking: You can use Deception to mislead an opponent into taking a potentially unwise action, such as trying to hit you while standing in front of an electrical junction box or at the edge of a precipice. If your Deception check opposed by Deception or Insight succeeds, your opponent is heedless of the potential danger and may hit the junction box or lose his balance and fall, if his attack against you fails.",

See the Illusion effect in the Powers chapter for details.\n\nDetect Influence: You can make an Insight check to notice someone acting under outside influence.

Three or more degrees give you a general idea of what is influencing them (and perhaps even whom, depending on the situation and the Gamemaster's  judgment).\n\nEvaluate: With an Insight check, opposed by Deception, you can tell if someone is trustworthy and honorable (or not) upon meeting them.

That is, the target retains his normal attitude, but will talk, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated.

If you can't accurately sense your target (you're elongating around a corner, for example), apply the rules for concealment (see Concealment in the Action & Adventure chapter).

So you cannot, for example, acquire Enhanced Trait as a Variable effect to improve a trait beyond its power level limit, or acquire effects or descriptors the Gamemaster has specifically banned from the series. The GM has final say as to whether or not a particular use of a Variable effect is appropriate and may veto your allocations, if necessary.\n\nYou must also place descriptors on your Variable effect limiting its scope. For example, a Variable effect that mimics other's traits is limited to the traits its subject(s) possess; a Variable effect providing you with traits suitable to different shapes is limited by the form(s) you assume; a Variable effect providing adaptations is limited to the stimulus to which it adapts, and so forth.
