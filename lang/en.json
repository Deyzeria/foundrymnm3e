  "MNM3E.exAccurateDesc": "An effect with this extra is especially accurate; you get +2 per Accurate rank to attack checks made with it. The power level limits maximum attack bonus with any given effect.",
  "MNM3E.exAffectsCorporealDesc": "An incorporeal being can use an effect with this extra on the corporeal world (see the Insubstantial effect description). When an effect is used against a corporeal target, the effect’s rank is equal to the rank of this extra, up to a maximum of the effect’s full rank. Characters with lower ranks 1–3 of Insubstantial do not require this extra for their effects to work on the physical world, although they can apply it to their Strength rank to allow them to exert some Strength while Insubstantial.",
  "MNM3E.exAffectsInsubstantialDesc": "An effect with this extra works on insubstantial targets, in addition to having its normal effect on corporeal targets. Rank 1 allows the effect to work at half its normal rank against insubstantial targets (rounded down); rank 2 allows the effect to function at its full rank against them.",
  "MNM3E.exAffectsObjectsDesc": "This modifier allows effects normally resisted by Fortitude to work on non-living objects (those with no Stamina). Generally, this extra applies to effects like Heal or Weaken, allowing them to work on objects in the same way as they do living creatures. If the effect Affects Only Objects, working on objects but not on living creatures, it has a net modifier of +0.<br><br>Objects do not get resistance checks; the effect works on the targeted object at its maximum degree of success. At the GM’s discretion, someone holding, carrying, or wearing an object can make a Dodge resistance check against the effect, representing pulling the object out of the way at the last moment.",
  "MNM3E.exAffectsOthersDesc": "This extra allows you to give someone else use of a personal effect. You must touch the subject as a standard action, and they have control over their use of the effect, although you can withdraw it when you wish as a free action. If you are unable to maintain the effect, it stops working, even if someone else is using it. Both you and your subject(s) can use the effect simultaneously.<br><br>If the effect Affects Only Others, and not you, it has a net modifier of +0.",
  "MNM3E.exAlternativeResistanceDesc": "An effect with this modifier has a different resistance than usual. The resistance check difficulty class remains the same, only the resistance differs. If the change is to a generally lower (and therefore more advantageous) resistance, this extra increases cost per rank by +1. If, in the GM’s opinion, there is no real increase in effectiveness, just a chance to the resistance, it has a net modifier of +0.",
  "MNM3E.exAreaDesc": "This extra allows an effect that normally works on a single target to affect an area. No attack check is needed; the effect simply fills the designated area, based on the type of modifier. Potential targets in the area are permitted a Dodge resistance check (DC 10 + effect rank) to avoid some of the effect (reflecting ducking for cover, dodging out of the way, and so forth). A successful resistance check reduces the Area effect to half its normal rank against that target (round down, minimum of 1 rank).<br><br><b>SHAPE</b><br><br>Choose one of the following options:<br><br><b>Burst</b>: The effect fills a sphere with a 30-foot radius (distance rank 0). Bursts on level surfaces (like the ground) create hemispheres 30 feet in radius and height.<br><br><b>Cloud</b>: The effect fills a sphere with a 15-foot radius (distance rank –1) that lingers in that area for one round after its duration expires (affecting any targets in the area normally during the additional round). Clouds on level surfaces (like the ground) create hemispheres 15 feet in radius and height.<br><br><b>Cone</b>: The effect fills a cone with a length, width, and height of 60 feet (distance rank 1), spreading out from the effect’s starting point. Cones on a level surface halve their final height.<br><br><b>Cylinder</b>: The effect fills a cylinder 30 feet in radius and height (distance rank 0).<br><br><b>Line</b>: The effect fills a path 5 feet wide and 30 feet long (distance rank 0) in a straight line.<br><br><b>Perception</b>: The effect works on anyone able to perceive the target point with a particular sense, chosen when you apply this extra, like a Sense-Dependent effect (see the Sense-Dependent modifier). Targets get a Dodge resistance check, as usual, but if the check is successful suffer no effect (rather than half). Concealment that prevents a target from perceiving the effect also blocks it. This modifier includes the Sense-Dependent flaw (see Flaws) so it cannot be applied again. If it is applied to an already Sense-Dependent effect, it costs 2 points per rank rather than 1.<br><br><b>Shapeable</b>: The effect fills a volume of 30 cubic feet (volume rank 5), and you may shape the volume as you wish, so long as it all remains contiguous.<br><br>Each +1 point increase in cost per rank moves the area’s distance rank up by 1. So a Burst Area with +2 cost per rank has a 60-foot radius (distance rank 1), a 120-foot radius at +3 cost per rank (distance rank 2), and so forth.<br><br><b>RANGE</b><br><br>The Area modifier interacts with different ranges as follows:<br><br><b>Close</b>: An effect must be at least close range in order to apply Area (personal range effects work only on the user by definition). A Close Area effect originates from the user and expands to fill the affected area; the user is not affected by it. So, for example, Close Burst Area Damage does not damage the user, who is at the center of the burst. This immunity does not apply to other effects, nor does it extend to anyone else: for that, apply the Selective extra. If the user wants to be affected at the same time, increase cost per rank by +1. An example would be a Close Burst Area Healing effect that included the user along with everyone else in the area. This is the equivalent of the +1 Affects Others modifier.<br><br><b>Ranged</b>: A ranged area effect can be placed anywhere within the effect’s range, extending to fill the area’s volume from the origin point.<br><br><b>Perception</b>: A perception area effect can be placed anywhere the user can accurately perceive. Perception area effects neither require an attack check nor allow a Dodge resistance check, although targets still get a normal resistance check against the effect. perception area effects are blocked by either concealment or cover; choose one when acquiring the effect. For concealment, if the attacker can’t accurately perceive a target in the area, it is unaffected. Thus even heavy smoke or darkness can block the effect. Effects blocked by cover are much like conventional area effects: solid barriers interfere with the effect, even if they are transparent, but the effect ignores concealment like darkness, shadows, or smoke. Only targets behind total cover are unaffected.",
  "MNM3E.exAttackDesc": "This extra applies to personal range effects, making them into attack effects. Examples include Shrinking and Teleport, causing a target to shrink or teleport away, respectively. Unlike most extras, the effect’s cost does not change, although it does work differently.<br><br>The effect no longer works on you (so a Teleport Attack can’t be used to teleport yourself, for example). It affects one creature of any size or 50 lbs. of inanimate mass. The effect has close range and requires a standard action and an attack check to touch the subject. Its range can be improved with the Range extra while its required action can be changed with the Action modifier. The target gets a resistance check, determined when the effect is made into an attack. Generally Dodge or Will is the most appropriate. A successful check negates the effect.<br><br>You must also define reasonably common circumstances that negate an Attack effect entirely, such as force fields or the ability to teleport blocking a Teleport Attack. You control the effect, and maintain it, if it has a duration longer than instant.<br><br>If you want both versions of an Attack effect, such as being able to Teleport yourself and Teleport others as an attack, take both as Alternate Effects. For the ability to use both options simultaneously—to teleport a target and yourself at the same time, for example—take the effects as separate powers.",
  "MNM3E.exContagiousDesc": "Contagious effects work on both the target and anyone coming into contact with the target. New targets resist the effect normally. They also become contagious, and the effect lingers until all traces of it have been eliminated. A Contagious effect is also eliminated if its duration expires. Examples of effects with this extra include “sticky” Afflictions trapping anyone touching them, disease- or toxin-based Weaken effects, or even a Nullify effect spreading from one victim to another.",
  "MNM3E.exDimensionalDesc": "This modifier allows an effect to work on targets in other dimensions (if any exist in the series). You affect your proximate location in the other dimension as if you were actually there, figuring range modifiers from that point.<br><br>One rank in Dimensional can affect a single other dimension. Two ranks can affect any of a related group of dimensions (mythic dimensions, mystic dimensions, fiendish planes, and so forth). Three ranks can reach into any other dimension in the setting.<br><br>For many effects, you may need a Dimensional Remote Sensing effect to target them. Targets in other dimensions you cannot sense have total concealment from you.",
  "MNM3E.exExtendedRangeDesc": "This modifier extends the distance over which a ranged effect works. Each rank of Extended Range doubles all of the effect’s range categories. So 1 rank makes short range (rank x 50 ft.), medium range (rank x 100 ft.) and long range (rank x 200 ft.). Each additional rank further doubles range.<br><br>The GM may set limits on the maximum Extended Range an effect can have; as a general guideline, effects used on a planetary surface are limited to the distance to the horizon (beyond which the curvature of the planet makes it impossible to see anything to target it). On Earth at sea level, this is roughly three miles (distance rank 10).",
  "MNM3E.exFeatureDesc": "The Feature effect can also serve as an effect modifier, essentially adding on some minor additional capability or benefit to a basic effect. Although listed here as an extra, this is essentially the same as having the Feature Linked to the base effect (see the Linked modifier later in this section); the Feature is an intrinsic part of the overall power, rather than separate.<br><br>As with the Feature effect, a Feature extra should be significant enough to be worth at least 1 character point and not solely based on the power’s descriptors. So, for example, a fiery Ranged Damage effect does not need a Feature to ignite fires; doing so is part of its “fire” descriptor and can be equally advantageous and problematic. A Ranged Damage effect that consistently “brands” its target with a visible and traceable mark, on the other hand, is an effect with an added Feature.",
  "MNM3E.exHomingDesc": "This modifier grants a ranged effect an additional opportunity to hit. If an attack check with a Homing effect fails, it attempts to hit again on the start of your next turn, requiring only a free action to maintain and allowing you to take other actions, including making another attack. Each rank in Homing grants the effect one additional attack check, but it still only gets one check per round.<br><br>The Homing effect uses the same accurate sense as the original attack to “track” its target, so concealment effective against that sense may confuse the effect and cause it to miss. If a Homing attack misses due to concealment, it has lost its “lock” on the target and does not get any further chances to hit. You can take Senses Linked to the Homing effect, if desired (to create things like radar-guided or heat-seeking missiles, for example). If a Homing attack is countered before it hits, it loses any remaining chances to hit. The same is true if it hits a different target.",
  "MNM3E.exIncreasedDurationDesc": "Effects have a standard duration: instant, sustained, continuous, or permanent. See Duration for details. This modifier increases an effect’s duration. Choose one of the following options:<br><br><b>Concentration</b>: When applied to an instant duration effect, this modifier makes it maintainable with concentration, taking a standard action each turn to do so. If the effect requires an initial attack check, no additional attack check is needed to maintain it on a target, but subsequent rounds of effect also do not benefit from critical hits. The target is affected on each of the effect user’s turns, making a normal resistance check (if any). Once the user stops concentrating for any reason, the effect ends and the target recovers normally, including resistance checks to remove ongoing effects.<br><br><b>Continuous</b>: When applied to a sustained duration effect, this modifier makes it continuous.",
  "MNM3E.exIncreasedMassDesc": "This modifier may apply to an effect that allows you to carry or affect a set amount of mass, typically a movement effect like Dimensional Travel or Teleport. Each rank of this extra increases the mass rank you can carry or move with the effect by 1. So Increased Mass 3 on Teleport allows you to carry up to 400 lbs. of extra mass with you when you teleport, for example.",
  "MNM3E.exIncreasedRangeDesc": "Effects have a standard range: personal, close, ranged, or perception. See Range for details. This modifier increases an effect’s range. Choose one of the following options. Increasing the range of an effect from personal to close requires either the Affects Others or Attack extras (see their descriptions). Making a close effect into a perception ranged effect requires two applications of this extra, for +2 cost per rank.<br><br><b>Ranged</b>: Applied to a close effect, this modifier makes it a ranged effect.<br><br><b>Perception</b>: When applied to a ranged effect, this modifier makes it perception range.",
  "MNM3E.exIncurableDesc": "Effects such as Healing and Regeneration cannot heal the damage caused by an effect with this modifier; the target must recover at the normal rate. Effects with the Persistent extra can heal Incurable damage.",
  "MNM3E.exIndirectDesc": "A ranged effect with this modifier can originate from a point other than the user, ignoring cover between the user and the target, such as walls and other intervening barriers, so long as they do not provide cover between the effect’s origin point and the target. An Indirect effect normally originates from a fixed point directed away from you. In some cases, an Indirect effect may count as a surprise attack (see Surprise Attack).<br><br><b>Indirect 1</b>: the effect originates from a fixed point away from you.<br><br><b>Indirect 2</b>: the effect can come from any point away from you or a fixed point in a fixed direction (not away from you).<br><br><b>Indirect 3</b>: The effect can come from any point in a fixed direction (not away from you) or a fixed point in any direction.<br><br><b>Indirect 4</b>: The effect can originate from any point and aim in any direction, including towards you (hitting a target in front of you from behind, for example).",
  "MNM3E.exInnateDesc": "An effect with this modifier is an innate part of your nature and unaffected by Nullify (see the Nullify effect). Gamemasters should exercise caution in allowing the application of Innate; the effect must be a truly inborn or essential trait, such as an elephant’s size or a ghost’s incorporeal nature. If the effect is not something normal to the character’s species or type, it probably isn’t innate.",
  "MNM3E.exInsidiousDesc": "Result of the effect is more difficult to detect.",
  "MNM3E.exLinkedDesc": "Two or more effects work together as one.",
